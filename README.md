## About Craft CMS

Craft is a content-first CMS that aims to make life enjoyable for developers and content managers alike. It is optimized for bespoke web and application development, offering developers a clean slate to build out exactly what they want, rather than wrestling with a theme.

## Roadmap

* Move to containerized builds in buddy.works & atomic deployments
* Move to Amazon S3 for assets, and utilize Cloudfront as well
* Convert local development over to Docker
